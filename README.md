This model was adopted from the flightgear.fgaddon.stable_2024\Aircraft hanger.




Fixed nav lights thanks to some help from N512CO. Also fixed lights so the wingtip lights are not directional (one was pointed forward the other back), but made tail light directional as should be.

Fixed main breaker issue with breaker always blowing.

Re-worked instruments lights so radio light brightness is adjusted when adjusting instrument lights, and disabled the bright red light that was adjusted with instrument lights that was being used to illuminate radio lights, also changed instrument lighting to as close to original looking. 

Changed visors to different glass.eff to stop rain from animating on them. 

Added several props to save between sessions.
